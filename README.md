## Creation Myths
A creation myth generator for a fantasy setting. Creation myths always contain a supreme being in charge of a certain domain (often that domain is a key point in the culture of the society). 
There are multiple ways of creation myth motif's. I'm just gonna hodgepodge them together into a reasonable list.
 
 1. Ex Nihilo - Creation is a product of a divine being.
 2. Earth Diver - A diver (can be any kind of creature) plunges to the primordial seabed to bring up sand/mud which develops into the world.
 3. Emergence Myths - Progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until the present world.
 4. Creation via Dismemberment of a primordial being.
 5. Creation by splitting/ordering of a primordial unity such as a cracking of the cosmic egg

I will also need a name generator as well as a grammar of divine domains to assign it to. Need to add new handling as tracery can't store generated objects for a next grammar pass.

## TO DO
- Using pytracery to handle grammars
- ASP ????
